# Emporium App

This is a marketplace, similar in spirit to Craigslist or Facebook Groups, that allows users to trade, buy, sell, and donate goods and services between each other.

For setup instructions, see [docs/SETUP.md](./docs/SETUP.md)

## Usage

As this is very early on in the development process, not a lot of features are implemented (see the roadmap below). That said, you are able to create new users and posts via the forms on `/create.html`. The posts are sent to a prototype moderation queue (`/moderation.html`) and if approved appear on the homepage (`/`).

## Roadmap / Planned Enhancements

* User accounts and access control
* File uploads for posts/replies
* HTTPS and SSL cert generation
* Server deployment instructions
* Email notifications
